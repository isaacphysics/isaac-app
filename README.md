# Isaac Physics front-end project

This project is based on the angular-seed application skeleton for a typical [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app.

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.  You should find that you have two new
folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the angular framework files

*Note that the `bower_components` folder would normally be installed in the root folder but
angular-seed changes this location through the `.bowerrc` file.  Putting it in the app folder makes
it easier to serve the files by a webserver.*

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the Isaac app at `http://localhost:8000/`.

### SASS Compilation

To keep the CSS updated automatically, run:

```
grunt watch
```

### Local optimisation

It is possible to test the optimisation build commands with the following grunt tasks:

* `grunt ngtemplates:local` - Compile the angular partial HTML templates into a single JS file. Replaces the dummy `app/js/templates.js`.
* `grunt requirejs:local` - Concatenate all JS into a single `app/js/isaac.js` file. Non-minified to aid debugging.


## Deployment

The `app` directory contains everything needed for the deployment, but there are some grunt tasks to help with packaging and optimisation.

Short version: Run `grunt dist`, then unzip `app.tar.gz` into the root www directory of the production server.

Long version:

* `grunt clean:dist` - Removes all auto-generated files created by this process.
* `grunt copy:dist` - Copies the `app` directory to `dist-app`.
* `grunt ngtemplates:dist` - Compiles all the HTML partials into one JS file.
* `grunt requirejs:dist` - Concatenates and uglifies all the JS, replacing `dist-app/js/isaac.js`
* `grunt compress:dist` - Packages up the entire `dist-app` directory into `dist-app.tar.gz`
* `grunt dist` - Run all the above commands in order.

## Testing

There are two kinds of tests in the angular-seed application: Unit tests and End to End tests.

### Running Unit Tests

The angular-seed app comes preconfigured with unit tests. These are written in
[Jasmine][jasmine], which we run with the [Karma Test Runner][karma]. We provide a Karma
configuration file to run them.

* the configuration is found at `test/karma.conf.js`
* the unit tests are found in `test/unit/`.

The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:

```
npm test
```

This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. Moreover, Karma will sit and
watch the source and test files for changes and then re-run the tests whenever any of them change.
This is the recommended strategy; if your unit tests are being run every time you save a file then
you receive instant feedback on any changes that break the expected code functionality.

You can also ask Karma to do a single run of the tests and then exit.  This is useful if you want to
check that a particular version of the code is operating as expected.  The project contains a
predefined script to do this:

```
npm run test-single-run
```


### End to end testing

The angular-seed app comes with end-to-end tests, again written in [Jasmine][jasmine]. These tests
are run with the [Protractor][protractor] End-to-End test runner.  It uses native events and has
special features for Angular applications.

* the configuration is found at `test/protractor-conf.js`
* the end-to-end tests are found in `test/e2e/`

Protractor simulates interaction with our web app and verifies that the application responds
correctly. Therefore, our web server needs to be serving up the application, so that Protractor
can interact with it.

```
npm start
```

In addition, since Protractor is built upon WebDriver we need to install this.  The angular-seed
project comes with a predefined script to do this:

```
npm run update-webdriver
```

This will download and install the latest version of the stand-alone WebDriver tool.

Once you have ensured that the development web server hosting our application is up and running
and WebDriver is updated, you can run the end-to-end tests using the supplied npm script:

```
npm run protractor
```

This script will execute the end-to-end tests against the application being hosted on the
development server.


## Updating
You can update the tool dependencies by running:

```
npm update
```

This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the `package.json` file.

You can update the Angular dependencies by running:

```
bower update
```

This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the `bower.json` file.
