# isaac-app

`isaac-app` was the front end interface for the [Isaac Physics project](https://isaacphysics.org/about) until August 2020. It was replaced by [isaac-react-app](https://github.com/isaacphysics/isaac-react-app) which is shared with the [Isaac Computer Science project](https://isaaccomputerscience.org/about).

The web interface was an AngularJS app, served by [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
