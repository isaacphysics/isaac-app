  <h4>Isaac Physics Skills</h4>
  <p><strong>By A. C. Machacek and J. J. Crowter</strong><br /> This area of our platform aims to provide an opportunity to practise the material that features directly in school exams.</p>
  <h4>How to use this area of Isaac?</h4>
  <p>Our intention is that having worked through the problems from the Machacek and Crowter book, you come to this part of Isaac to check your answers.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Clicking on one of the chapter links below will take you to a hexagon board with each hexagon representing a page of the book.</li>
